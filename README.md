# Midas Lambrichts: Curriculum Vitae
My codified CV.

## Rationale
When creating earlier versions of my CV, I always found it annoying that I had to take care of what was in there and how it looked at once. Wanting to change how something looked often meant I needed to also update the look of the similar/related items.

To combat this issue, I opted for a separation of data and representation, by turning my CV into a website. Now there is a separate part for data, and a separate part for representation, meaning I can update one or the other (or both).

## Stack
This CV is created with a Rust stack. It compiles to wasm which will build up the CV once loaded. 

## Development
Install `trunk` and run `trunk serve`.
